# CaffeiNet
### (Currently Under Construction)
## What is it?
CaffeiNet is a deep learning framework focused on having clean, interpretable source code in order for people who are new to deep
learning to understand what's happening at the implementation level. However, this means trading computational efficiency for readability
at times. As such, this framework is not expected to handle data at the practical level.
## Motivation
My name is Harold Rubio and I am a junior year Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. I have taken the
courses: CS383, which is a junior level introduction to artificial intelligence (however, during the semester I took it, the course was
highly skewed towards reinforcement learning), and CS589, which is a graduate level introduction to machine learning. The first part of
my motivation lies within these courses. In CS383, we went over the basics of neural networks: backpropagation, activation functions,
etc. but there was never a task to implement these. In CS589, the content we went over was identical and this time there was an assignment;
however, this assignment only required us to use the sklearn implementation to train a single hidden layer feed forward network.

This semester, Spring 2019, I have been sitting in on the lectures for CS690D, a graduate level introduction to deep learning for
natural language processing where various architectures have been mentioned in theory. With this project, I hope to finally demystify
the details of implementing deep learning models.

The second part of my motivation lies within the education of computer science. The high school that I graduated from is slowly phasing out
its computer science courses from its curriculum. Instead, enticing students into taking a single class on "video game programming" which
has replaced the series of courses that would build up the fundamentals of computer science. I don't think high school students should be
fooled into pursuing computer science because of creating video games; but appreciating how powerful of a tool programming can be in
solving problems in the real world. I hope to present a guest lecture to the students in computer science from my old high school
to show them how computer science is used in real world applications while also giving them a taste of the rigor that goes into majoring
in computer science.

## Todo List
My hope is to implement the models that were mentioned in CS690D by building everything, down to the foundation, from scratch.
- Fundamentals
  - Matrix Operations and Statistics
- Computational Graphs
- Feed-Foward Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
  - Gated Recurrent Unit RNN
  - Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN
- Transformer
