## Motivation
My name is Harold Rubio and I am a junior year Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. I have taken the
courses: CS383, which is a junior level introduction to artificial intelligence (however, during the semester I took it, the course was
highly skewed towards reinforcement learning), and CS589, which is a graduate level introduction to machine learning. The first part of
my motivation lies within these courses. In CS383, we went over the basics of neural networks: backpropagation, activation functions,
etc. but there was never a task to implement these. In CS589, the content we went over was identical and this time there was an assignment;
however, this assignment only required us to use the sklearn implementation to train a single hidden layer feed forward network.

This semester, Spring 2019, I have been sitting in on the lectures for CS690D, a graduate level introduction to deep learning for
natural language processing where various architectures have been mentioned in theory. With this project, I hope to finally demystify
the details of implementing deep learning models.

The second part of my motivation lies within the education of computer science. The high school that I graduated from is slowly phasing out
its computer science courses from its curriculum. Instead, enticing students into taking a single class on "video game programming" which
has replaced the series of courses that would build up the fundamentals of computer science. I don't think high school students should be
fooled into pursuing computer science because of creating video games; but appreciating how powerful of a tool programming can be in
solving problems in the real world. I hope to present a guest lecture to the students in computer science from my old high school
to show them how computer science is used in real world applications while also giving them a taste of the rigor that goes into majoring
in computer science.

## Todo List
My hope is to implement the models that were mentioned in CS690D by building everything, down to the foundation, from scratch.
